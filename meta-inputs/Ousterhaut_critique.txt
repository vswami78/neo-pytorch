As John Ousterhout, author of "A Philosophy of Software Design," I would analyze the neo-pytorch project through the lens of the principles outlined in my book. Here's how I might critique the project:
Complexity and Cognitive Load:
The project seems to handle complex heterogeneous graphs, which is inherently challenging. However, the use of a configuration file and modular structure helps manage this complexity. I would encourage further efforts to reduce cognitive load, perhaps by introducing more abstraction layers or simplifying the API where possible.
Deep Modules:
The InteractiveGraphExplorer class appears to encapsulate a significant amount of functionality, which aligns with my principle of creating "deep" modules. However, I'd want to ensure that its interface remains simple and that it doesn't leak unnecessary implementation details.
Information Hiding:
The use of a configuration file is a good example of information hiding, as it separates the graph structure definition from the core logic. I'd encourage extending this principle further, perhaps by encapsulating more of the graph manipulation logic behind cleaner interfaces.
4. General-Purpose Modules:
The project's ability to handle different types of graphs through configuration is a step towards creating general-purpose modules. However, I'd encourage thinking about how to make the core components even more general and reusable across different graph-based applications.
5. Defining Errors Out of Existence:
I'd be interested in seeing how the project handles error cases. Are there opportunities to design interfaces that make certain errors impossible, rather than just handling them when they occur?
Comments and Documentation:
While the code structure seems logical, I'd emphasize the importance of strategic comments that explain "why" certain design decisions were made, not just "what" the code does. This is especially important in complex systems like graph analysis tools.
Incremental Development:
The modular structure and use of standard libraries like NetworkX suggest an incremental approach to development. I'd encourage continuing this practice, focusing on small, manageable changes that gradually enhance the system's capabilities.
Separation of Concerns:
The separation of the main script, explorer class, and utilities is good. I'd encourage thinking about whether there are opportunities for further separation, perhaps isolating the graph data structure manipulation from the visualization logic more cleanly.
9. Tactical vs. Strategic Programming:
The project seems to have a strategic approach in its overall architecture. However, I'd caution against falling into tactical programming when adding new features. Each addition should be considered in terms of its long-term impact on the system's design.
Consistency:
With multiple components and potential for extension, maintaining consistency in naming conventions, coding style, and API design is crucial. I'd recommend establishing and documenting clear conventions for the project.
11. Code Should Be Obvious:
Given the complexity of graph operations, extra effort should be made to make the code as self-explanatory as possible. This might involve rethinking some method names or restructuring some operations to be more intuitive.
Design It Twice:
For critical components like the graph exploration algorithm or data loading process, I'd recommend exploring alternative designs. This process often leads to insights that improve the final implementation.
In conclusion, while the neo-pytorch project demonstrates several good design principles, there's always room for improvement in software architecture. The key is to continuously refactor and rethink the design as the project evolves, always striving for simplicity and clarity in the face of inherent complexity.
